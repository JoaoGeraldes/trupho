### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn start-server`

Starts the server API (backend)
(Use another terminal instance)

### `yarn start`

## Some notes about this demo

To run this project, start the server first, with `yarn start-server`
Then `yarn start` (on another CLI instance) to run the frontend.

1- The tiers are being fetched by a small node API via GET request.
2- Some tests were made (although they are quite simple) for Tiers, Tier and Toggle, though some of them are missing namely, due to time constraints.
3- If you guys need more clarification let me know :)
